- **'uusi'** - Create new household that others can join

### Finnish Invoice Standards

### Smart Household Billing

- One invoice per household regardless of member count
- Automatic invoice line generation for each household member
- Empty household cleanup when last member leaves
- Flexible billing address management

## Development

### Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically on startup:
- `migrations/001_initial.sql` - Initial schema
- `migrations/002_add_fields.sql` - Additional fields

### Backend Commands

Key Tauri commands exposed to frontend:
- Organization CRUD operations
- Member and household management
- Invoice generation and payment tracking

### Technical Notes

- SQLite DECIMAL values handled with fallback to INTEGER
- Frontend uses camelCase, backend uses snake_case
